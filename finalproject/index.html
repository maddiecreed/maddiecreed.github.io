                    <p> Why is there less party unity among Republicans than Democrats on the issue? Are there demographic differences between Republican districts that vote for school vouchers and those that vote against?</p>

                    <p>We can compare demographics of Republican districts who voted "Yes" versus Republican districts who voted "No". Hover over an attribute to see more information.</p>

                    <p>We can further compare these demographics between states and one state versus all states. Consider Georgia, which has a different ordering of demographics compared to all states</p>

                <div class="step" id="step7" role="region" aria-label="Georgia specific analysis">
                    <p>In constrast to most states, in Georgia a higher black population tends to correlate with more votes <strong>against</strong> the bill. One potential reason is that the Black population's size provides more voting power for Black people to vote against the bill. Or, given the history of freedom schools in Georgia, Black Georgian's may be more likely to support private schools. </p>
